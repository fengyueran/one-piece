## 🧭 Design Philosophy

### Navigation-Centric

Every component is designed to guide users naturally through their journey, like a compass pointing the way.

### Consistent & Reliable

Just as a compass always points north, our components provide consistent behavior and appearance across your application.

### Intuitive Direction

Clear visual hierarchy and interaction patterns that feel natural and predictable.
